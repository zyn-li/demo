storm and roman semenov highlights their alleged role in creating a cryptocurrency mixer that ultimately served as a gateway for the laundering of more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds. as alleged, when it became clear that a sanctioned north korean cybercrime organization was using the platform to launder hundreds of millions of dollars derived from cyber heists, storm and semenov turned a blind eye to the illicit activity and made public representations that they were compliant with sanctions laws. today's enforcement actions remind the public that the fbi, when faced with illegal activity, is committed to tracing the untraceable, and will remain focused on protecting victims of financial crime wherever those crimes are committed  be it through the traditional banking system or the virtual currency blockchain.    as alleged in the indictment unsealed in manhattan federal court and court filings: [1]    roman storm and roman semenov were two of the three founders of the tornado cash service, a cryptocurrency mixer that allowed its customers to engage in untraceable transfers of cryptocurrency. the defendants and their co-conspirators created the core features of the tornado cash service, paid for critical infrastructure to operate the tornado cash service, promoted the tornado cash service, and made millions of dollars in profits from operating the tornado cash service. the tornado cash service advertised to customers that it provided untraceable and anonymous financial transactions, and storm and semenov chose not to implement know your customer or anti-money laundering programs as required by law. as a result, the tornado cash service was used to launder more than $1 billion in criminal proceeds. storm and semenov knew about these money laundering transactions and received complaints and requests for help from victims of hacking and other cybercrimes. however, they refused to implement any controls and continued to operate the tornado cash service and facilitate these money laundering transactions.    in april and may 2022, the tornado cash service was allegedly used by the lazarus group, a sanctioned north korean cybercrime organization, to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in hacking proceeds. storm and semenov knew that the tornado cash service they were operating was engaging in these sanctions-violating transactions. they implemented a change in the service so that they could make a public announcement that they were compliant with sanctions, but in their private chats, they agreed that this change would be ineffective. they then continued to operate the tornado cash service and facilitate hundreds of millions of dollars in further sanctions-violating transactions, helping the lazarus group to transfer criminal proceeds from a cryptocurrency wallet that had been designated by the office of foreign assets control as blocked property.    roman storm of auburn, washington, and roman semenov, a russian national, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of conspiracy to violate the international economic emergency powers act, which each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. they are also each charged with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.    the statutory maximum sentences are prescribed by congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by a judge.    mr. williams praised the investigative work of the fbi and irs-ci. he also acknowledged the assistance of the justice department's office of international affairs. mr. williams further thanked the joint chiefs of global tax enforcement (j5) for their assistance in the investigation.    this case is being handled by the office's money laundering and transnational criminal enterprises unit and the criminal division's national cryptocurrency enforcement team (ncet). assistant u.s. attorneys thane rehn and benjamin gianforti are in charge of the prosecution.    the ncet was established to combat the growing illicit use of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. within the criminal division's computer crime and intellectual property section, the ncet conducts and supports investigations into individuals and entities that enable the use of digital assets to commit and facilitate a variety of crimes, with a particular focus on virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and infrastructure providers. the ncet also sets strategic priorities regarding digital asset technologies, identifies areas for increased investigative and prosecutorial focus, and leads the department's efforts to collaborate with domestic and foreign government agencies as well as the private sector to aggressively investigate and prosecute crimes involving cryptocurrency and digital assets.

igor fleyshmakher previously pleaded guilty and was sentenced in november 2021 to 41 months in prison.    according to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:    the prime aid pharmacies  now closed  operated as specialty pharmacies in union city, new jersey, and bronx, new york, processing expensive medications used to treat various conditions, including hepatitis c, crohn's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. sevumyants was prime aid union city's operations manager. khaimov was a co-owner of prime aid union city and the lead pharmacist of prime aid bronx. khaimov's wife, shtindler, was prime aid union city's administrator. alex fleyshmakher worked at prime aid union city and was an on-paper owner of prime aid bronx. his father, igor fleyshmakher, was a co-owner of prime aid union city.    initially, the prime aid pharmacies obtained retail network agreements with several pharmacy benefit managers (pbms), which allowed them to receive reimbursement payments to prescription medications, including specialty medications. pbms acted as intermediaries on behalf of medicare, medicaid, and private healthcare insurance providers, so that when a pharmacy received a prescription, the pharmacy then submitted a claim for reimbursement to the pbm that represented the beneficiary's drug plan.    starting in 2009, to obtain a higher volume of prescriptions, khaimov, sevumyants, alex fleyshmakher, and other prime aid employees paid bribes to doctors and doctors' employees to induce doctors' offices to steer prescriptions to the prime aid pharmacies. the bribes included expensive meals and payments by cash, check, and wire transfers. another method of bribery also involved paying an employee to work inside a doctor's office.    prime aid union city  at the direction of sevumyants, shtindler, and khaimov  also engaged in the pervasive fraudulent practice of billing health insurance providers for medications that were never provided to patients. while prime aid generally provided medications for initial prescriptions it received, it systematically billed for refills for those same medications without ever dispensing them to patients. from 2013 through 2017, prime aid union city received tens of millions of dollars in reimbursement payments from medicare, medicaid, and private insurers for medications that prime aid union city not only failed to give patients, but never ordered or had in stock at the pharmacy.    pbms conducted routine audits of prime aid union city and discovered its practice of billing but not dispensing medications. in response to these audits, shtindler instructed prime aid employees to falsify records submitted to the pbms. sevumyants, with shtindler's knowledge and approval, forged shipping records of a private commercial shipping company to make it appear as if medications were shipped to the patients when they were not.    the conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud count is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison and the conspiracy to pay illegal kickbacks is punishable by a maximum of five years in prison. both counts are also punishable by a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greatest. sentencing is scheduled for dec. 20, 2023.    u.s. attorney sellinger credited special agents of internal revenue service criminal investigation, under the direction of special agent in charge tomlins in newark;

ana, ca  the former mayor of anaheim has agreed to plead guilty to federal felony charges for obstructing an fbi public corruption investigation by destroying evidence and for making false statements to fbi agents, the justice department announced today.    in court documents filed today in united states district court, harish harry singh sidhu of anaheim, also admits cheating california tax authorities and making false statements to the federal aviation administration in relation to his purchase of a helicopter.    federal prosecutors today filed a criminal information charging sidhu with one count of obstruction of justice, one count of wire fraud, and two counts of making false statements to the fbi and the faa. in a plea agreement also filed today, sidhu agreed to plead guilty to the four offenses.    according to his plea agreement, sidhu  a longtime member of the anaheim city council who was elected mayor in 2018  admitted that while the city of anaheim was negotiating the sale of angel stadium to the los angeles angels major league baseball club, he sought out and became a member of the city's negotiating team for the stadium sale. while on the negotiating team, sidhu provided confidential information belonging to the city to people working for the angels, so that the angels could buy angel stadium on favorable terms for the baseball club. after secretly providing the information he had received in his position as mayor, sidhu later was recorded saying he expected a $1 million campaign contribution from the angels after the baseball club purchased angel stadium, the plea agreement states.    while serving as anaheim's mayor, mr. sidhu took a series of actions that compromised the city's negotiating position by providing confidential information and secretly working to influence the city's decision-making process  all of which had a detrimental effect on the city and its residents, said first assistant united states attorney joseph t. mcnally. public confidence in the integrity of public officials is critical to our society. this office will continue to root out public officials who compromise their integrity.    the public places a lot of trust and confidence in elected officials, which mr. sidhu violated, said special agent in charge tyler hatcher, internal revenue service criminal investigation (ci), los angeles field office. working with our law enforcement partners, we were able to prevent mr. sidhu from causing greater harm to the anaheim community.    mr. sidhu was elected by and pledged to work for the residents of anaheim, but he violated that pledge and their trust on numerous occasions to look out for special interests, said donald alway, the assistant director in charge of the fbi's los angeles field office. mr. sidhu deceived his colleagues and weakened the city's official strategy by divulging intellectual property, then lied to the government when his corruption was discovered. i'm proud of the hard work put in by agents and prosecutors which resulted in today's plea agreement.    sidhu admitted that he knowingly destroyed evidence by deleting multiple email messages and documents with the intent to impede and obstruct the fbi's investigation of public corruption related to the city's attempted sale of angel stadium. in the plea agreement, sidhu specifically admitted he deleted an email message he had sent on july 21, 2020, with an attachment drafted by lawyers for the city, which contained confidential negotiation information related to the potential sale of angel stadium, including a discussion of issues related to price.    sidhu also admitted in his plea agreement that he deleted a september 2020 email message about secret mock anaheim city council meetings involving sidhu, two other city council members and representatives of the angels  including the team president and a team lawyer. those mock city council meetings would precede the scheduled public city council meeting about the city's proposed sale of angel stadium. the deleted email message had an attachment titled angels council debate prep, which detailed the topics on which each participant of the mock city council meetings should focus, and it added [angels] team available to help develop 'zingers', responses, and other points to improve performance.    sidhu also admitted he had provided a confidential appraisal range to the angels in 2019, months before the appraisal was made public.    during the investigation, fbi agents secretly recorded multiple statements by sidhu about the $1 million campaign contribution that he expected to receive after the city of anaheim sold angel stadium to the angels, the plea agreement states.    sidhu also admitted that he lied about the angel stadium sale negotiations and related matters when fbi agents interviewed him on may 12, 2022. for example, during that interview, sidhu falsely stated that he was expecting nothing from the angels after the angel stadium sale, when in truth, he was expecting to receive a $1 million campaign contribution for his election after the sale. sidhu also admitted to lying about using his personal email for city business. not only did [sidhu] conduct city business using his personal email, but he also communicated with some city staff using that staff's personal email, purposely avoiding using the staff member's official city email address, the plea agreement states.    in his plea agreement, sidhu also admitted that in late 2020, he tried to defraud the state of california of approximately $16,000 in sales tax revenue by using an arizona address to register a helicopter he had just purchased, even though he lived in anaheim. sidhu admitted that he fraudulently used a mailing address in scottsdale, arizona that actually belonged to an anaheim businessperson.    sidhu also admitted that he provided false information for the helicopter to the federal aviation administration when he submitted an aircraft registration application that he signed and certified as true, but which falsely claimed his permanent mailing address was in arizona.    sidhu is expected to make his initial appearance in united states district court in santa ana later this month.    once sidhu enters his guilty pleas, he will face a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison for the obstruction of justice count, up to 20 years in federal prison for the wire fraud count, and up to five years in federal prison for each false statements count.    ci and fbi are conducting the

is accused of exploiting that trust by orchestrating this unscrupulous scheme and misusing federal cares act funds to cover up his criminal behavior. this indictment serves as a message that the fbi and our partners are working hard every day to protect taxpayers.    the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security (cares) act was a federal law enacted in march 2020 to provide emergency financial assistance to americans suffering from the economic effects caused by the covid-19 pandemic. financial assistance offered through the cares act included forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the paycheck protection program. ppp loan applications were processed and funded by participating lenders with a 100% guarantee by the small business administration (sba).    according to the three-count indictment, in january 2018, non-profit 1 entered into a fiscal sponsorship arrangement with scb under which scb provided administrative support for non-profit 1, including fiduciary services, governance, and funds management. in return, scb received a regular payment from non-profit 1 for services rendered. the parties signed a memorandum of agreement that required scb to deposit funds received on behalf of non-profit 1 into a restricted set of funding sources in scbs fiscal management system. non-profit 3 and non-profit 5 entered into similar fiscal sponsorship arrangements with scb, including an agreement with each non-profit to deposit its funds into a set of restricted funding sources. scb also had a fiscal sponsorship arrangement with non-profit 4 which contained an agreement by scb to provide services with integrity and responsibility and noted that funds must be disbursed according to strict irs [internal revenue service] standards.    scbs alleged mismanagement of non-profit client funds    the indictment further alleges that scb did not set up restricted funding sources for funds related to non-profit 1, non-profit 3 or non-profit 5, instead depositing those funds into scbs general checking account (the 4885 account). from august 2016 through december 2019, scb received funds and improperly used client assets with donor restrictions to fund scbs own operating expenses, contrary to its agreement with the clients to safeguard those funds on the clients behalf.    for example, on january 24, 2018, non-profit 1 transferred approximately $451,866.19 to scb for fiscal management. scb entered the full amount of non-profit 1s funds into the 4485 account and did not segregate the funds or make any attempt to ensure that the money was used only for non-profit 1. as detailed in the indictment, scb used these funds to pay general expenses unrelated to non-profit 1. in april 2020, non-profit 1 merged with non-profit 2, a larger maryland non-profit organization with a similar purpose. scb provided regular statements of revenue and expenditures to non-profit 1 and, after its merger, to non-profit 2. these statements listed ending fund balance for non-profit 1 which were often far greater than scbs total assets.  for example, on july 31, 2019, scb reported to non-profit 1 that non-profit 1 had approximately $653,000 in an ending fund balance. but at that time, scbs total assets on hand were approximately $286,000. on january 31, 2020, scb reported that non-profit 1 had approximately $827,000 in an ending fund balance. at that time, scbs total assets on hand was approximately $339,000, a shortfall of over $480,000.    on august 28, 2020, a member of the leadership team of non-profit 2 spoke by phone with davis about ending non-profit 2s fiscal relationship with scb and creating a payment schedule for scb to transfer back to non-profit 2 its total outstanding funds, which equaled approximately $600,000. davis agreed that scb would provide the total outstanding balance to non-profit 2 with an initial 25% payment, to be followed by four equal payments that were to be made by january 2021. davis assured non-profit 2s representative that scb was able to meet this obligation but needed to manage the disbursements over a longer period of time because of financial demands across scbs portfolio of organizations. despite numerous promises by davis and other scb employees, by march 2021, scb had made only one payment to non-profit 2 of approximately $319,000 and still owed approximately $610,207.    march 13, 2021 ppp loan    from january 2021 to march 2021, davis allegedly submitted six ppp loan applications on behalf of scb to bank 1, a participating ppp lender, in order to cover shortfalls in scbs accounts that were owed to the fiscally-sponsored organizations. according to the indictment, these shortfalls had arisen because scb improperly used assets with donor restrictions to pay scb operating expenses, including salaries to its own employees.  each ppp loan application contained false statements, including varying amounts of average monthly payroll for scb and the intended use of the loan funds. davis electronically signed all the applications, certifying that any funds received would be used for allowed purposes.  in furtherance of the scheme, davis also caused scb to open a new bank account (the 3365 account), although no funds were placed in the account. on may 13, 2021, davis was notified that scbs application had been approved.    in anticipation of receiving the ppp loan funds, davis sent an email to an scb employee with a list of priorities. davis allegedly stated, among my list please it should include outstanding ap [accounts payable], outstanding rent and non-profit 1, and board member loans. payments for board member loans and debt settlement with non-profit 1 were not allowable uses of ppp funds.    on march 16, 2021, bank 1 deposited approximately $1,426,922 in ppp funds into the 4485 account and on march 23, 2021, davis caused $800,000 to be transferred from the 4485 account to the 3365 account. prior to the transfer, the 3365 account had a negative balance of approximately $20.00, after being charged a bank fee for not having funds in the account. on march 29, 2021, the full balance of $799,980.00 was transferred from the 3365 account back to 4485 account.  that amount represented the $800,000 of ppp loan proceeds minus the $20.00 debit in the 3365 account.    as detailed in the indictment, between march 26, 2021 and april 2, 2021, davis and scb used a total of approximately $625,405.64 in ppp loan funds to close out scbs fiscal sponsorship arrangement with non-profit 2, non-profit 3, and non-profit 4, all of which had terminated their fiscal sponsorship arrangements with scb between june and september 2020. on april 9, 2021, $6252.39 was transferred from the 4485 account to non-profit 5. neither davis nor any other scb employee informed their former non-profit clients that the funds they received were the proceeds of a ppp loan, or that there were any restrictions on the use of funds.    if convicted, davis faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for wire fraud and a maximum of 10 years in federal prison for each of two counts of money laundering. actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the u.s. sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors.    an indictment is not a finding of guilt. an individual charged by indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.    the district of maryland strike force is one of three strike forces established throughout the united states by the u.s. department of justice to investigate and prosecute

that certain well-known individuals would be on the phh advisory board and certain well-known entertainers, businesspeople, and politicians will be a part of the club; and that gerry matthews was a member of the palm house, llc management team and was the 99 percent owner of the project. eb-5 investors invested in the phh project by providing money to bank accounts controlled by sarc. sarc, in turn, provided eb-5 money earmarked for phh use into accounts controlled by robert matthews and his associates.    while gerry matthews was the nominal 99 percent owner of palm house, llc, robert matthews controlled the company. in addition, there was no evidence any of the proffered well-known individuals would be on the phh advisory board or would be members of the club. robert matthews and others used eb-5 funding for purposes not related to the phh project, including for robert matthews' personal gain.    through this scheme, approximately 61 eb-5 investors lost a total of more than $30 million.    as part of this scheme, robert matthews and others moved investor funds through various bank accounts located in connecticut and florida. the funds were used to pay robert matthews', and his wife's, maria matthews, credit card debts, and to purchase two properties located in washington depot, connecticut. one of the washington depot properties was a property that robert matthews had previously lost in foreclosure. robert matthews, nicholas laudano, and others conspired to purchase the property out of foreclosure by concealing both the relationship between the co-conspirators, and the source of the funds used to purchase the property.    laudano was a construction contractor who continuously worked on the development of the phh project between approximately 2006 and 2016. he also has operated several restaurants in florida and connecticut.    in addition, robert and maria matthews evaded paying federal income tax they owed for the 2005 and 2007 calendar years in multiple ways, including by using limited liability companies, a company bank account, and their attorney's trust account to pay for personal expenses. for example, in approximately november 2014, robert matthews caused maria matthews to execute documents to obtain a loan from an individual. the loan was secured by one of their washington depot properties, which, at the time, was in the name of a shell company. the proceeds of this loan were eventually disbursed into an account controlled by robert and maria matthews in the name of mirabia llc. robert and maria matthews subsequently used the loan proceeds for personal expenses without paying any of their outstanding tax liability.    this tax evasion scheme resulted in a loss to the internal revenue service of approximately $2.75 million in taxes, interest, and penalties.    the investigation also revealed that, between approximately 2007 and 2009, robert matthews conspired with others in a scheme to defraud t.d. banknorth, n.a. (now td bank, n.a.), out of the proceeds of a construction loan by making material misrepresentations to the bank in connection with the development of the point breeze hotel in nantucket, massachusetts. at the time matthews defaulted on the loan, td bank was owed approximately $34 million. after td bank foreclosed on the loan, it was owed approximately $12 million. in june 2010, matthews conspired with others in a scheme to defraud td bank out of its ability to foreclose on another parcel of property in nantucket owned by matthews and recover the $12 million dollar debt.    finally, between approximately december 2010 and january 2013, robert matthews conspired with others to defraud jp morgan chase bank n.a. by misappropriating insurance proceeds earmarked for repair of one of his washington depot properties.    on april 25, 2019, robert matthews pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, making illegal monetary transactions, and tax evasion.    matthews, who is released on bond, is required to report to prison on october 23.    restitution will be determined after additional court proceedings.    on april 25, 2019, maria matthews, also known as mia matthews, pleaded guilty to tax evasion. she awaits sentencing.    on march 7, 2018, gerry matthews, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. he also awaits sentencing.    on march 12, 2018, laudano pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and to making illegal monetary transactions. on june 4, 2023, he was sentenced to three years of supervised release.    this matter has been investigated by internal revenue service  criminal investigation division and the federal bureau of investigation. the case is being prosecuted by assistant u.s. attorneys john t. pierpont, jr. and david e. novick."

newsroom@ci.irs.gov    los angeles  a fresno hairstylist and an actress have been charged in a 12 count indictment alleging they defrauded a physician out of more than $2.7 million before his death and then attempted to defraud his estate out of an additional amount exceeding $20 million, the justice department announced today.    anthony david flores, a.k.a. anton david, of fresno, was arrested last week in fresno by federal agents. he has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and is scheduled for a detention hearing on february 10 in the eastern district of california.    his co-defendant, anna rene moore, an actress and former yoga studio owner who currently resides in monterrey, mexico, was arrested tuesday in houston upon arrival on a flight from mexico. she made her initial appearance in the southern district of texas. both defendants are expected to appear in los angeles federal court in the coming weeks.    flores and moore are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, two counts of wire fraud, two counts of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy to engage in money laundering, two counts of money laundering, and one count of engaging in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property.    according to the indictment, beginning in june 2017, flores and moore used false promises and representations to befriend the victim  a physician and successful investor worth more than $60 million, but who suffered from a mental illness and lost the ability to care for himself. within days of meeting the victim, flores and moore moved into the victim's beachfront malibu home  rent free  and slowly took control of his life by pretending to be his new best friends and caregivers.    in september 2017, after the victim suffered a severe mental breakdown resulting in his arrest and detention in los angeles county jail, flores allegedly fraudulently induced the victim to sign powers of attorney granting flores control over the victim's finances.    flores allegedly represented that he would only use these powers to access the victim's finances to post bail for release, and that he would immediately rescind them once the victim was free from jail. but after the victim was released from custody, flores allegedly reneged on this promise and used these powers to open bank accounts in the victim's name, giving himself and moore access to the victim's wealth.    from september 2017 to may 2018, flores and moore allegedly diverted the victim's funds to their own bank accounts, isolated the victim from his family and longtime friends and provided the victim with drugs, including marijuana and lsd.    in the final days of the victim's life, flores and moore allegedly gave the victim lsd, which caused his mental state to severely deteriorate. while the victim was under the influence of lsd, flores allegedly changed the two-step authentication feature on the victim's $60-million online brokerage account after previously changing the phone number listed on the account from the victim's phone number to his own phone number.    four days before the victim's death and while the victim was still under the influence of lsd that defendants allegedly had provided to him, flores then allegedly initiated two $1-million wires from the victim's brokerage account to accounts that flores controlled, including flores' personal bank account. flores and moore then left the victim, who by this time was in mental distress and had evicted them from his home. from a luxury hotel paid with the victim's funds, flores and moore allegedly watched the victim's deteriorating mental condition on the video cameras installed throughout the malibu beach house.    in may 2018, the victim died in his malibu home. following the victim's death, flores and moore moved back into the victim's malibu beachfront home and allegedly withdrew large sums of money from his accounts. they allegedly also concealed information about the victim's finances from his mother and sister, both of whom resided in florida. this prompted the victim's family to file a lawsuit, which uncovered the alleged fraud.    in the ensuing lawsuit in los angeles superior court, flores and moore allegedly violated multiple court orders ordering them to return the funds stolen from the victim. they allegedly attempted to launder the fraudulent proceeds by funneling the money through multiple different accounts to thwart the victim's estate and court-appointed receiver from recouping the money. the lawsuit was settled with flores and moore agreeing to repay the victim's estate $1 million, which they have so far failed to do.    an indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.    if convicted on all counts, flores and moore would face statutory maximum sentences of 20 years in prison for each fraud count, 20 years on the conspiracy to commit money laundering and laundering of monetary instruments counts, 10 years on transactional money laundering count, and a mandatory two-year prison sentence for the aggravated identity theft count.    the irs criminal investigation and fbi investigated this matter.    assistant united states attorney andrew

internal revenue service, criminal investigation (irs-ci), special agent in charge of the oakland field office darren lian; federal bureau of investigation special agent in charge robert k. tripp; u.s. postal inspection service (uspis) pittsburgh division inspector in charge lesley allison; and u.s. food and drug administration office of criminal investigations (fda-oci) special agent in charge of the metro washington field office george a. scavdis. the verdicts were handed down after a two-week trial before the hon. charles r. breyer, senior u.s. district judge.    the health and safety of american patients are critical, and americans are entitled to trust that the prescription drugs they take are safe, said u.s. attorney hinds. those who undermine the safety of the prescription drug supply chain for their own gain by laundering diverted drugs put those patients at risk, and they will be prosecuted.    when medical practitioners prescribe and patients receive medication, their focus should be on the effectiveness of the medication for the intended treatment and not the authenticity or legitimacy of the pills they get from pharmacies. the speedy guilty verdict shows the community's intolerance of those who betray this basic trust in our healthcare system for greed and personal enrichment. irs criminal investigation is committed to work with our law enforcement partners to dismantle and disrupt these criminal schemes and to instill trust and confidence in the system, said special agent in charge lian. i truly commend the case agents and the trial team who worked tirelessly on this case to bring justice to light.    fda is responsible for oversight of the prescription drug supply chain; when criminals breach the security around that chain, patients can no longer be assured of the safety or effectiveness of the stolen drugs that are returned illegally to the legitimate supply pipeline, said special agent in charge scavdis. we will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who would put the public health at risk through their criminal actions.    the illegal conduct of david miller was reprehensible, said fbi special agent in charge robert tripp. he and his co-conspirators undermined safeguards designed to protect the public, reintroduced diverted prescription drugs into the supply chain, and compromised patient safety for personal gain.    the trial was the result of indictments filed in two separate districtsthe northern district of california and the southern district of ohio. the convictions included charges handed down in a second superseding indictment by a grand jury in the northern district of california on february 11, 2016, and by a separate indictment handed down on may 6, 2015, in the southern district of ohio. both indictments involved additional defendants and charges that were not presented at the trial.    the evidence at trial established that miller, of santa ana, california, was at the center of a vast racketeering enterprise responsible for the fraudulent distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of diverted prescription drugs, including instances in which miller and his co-conspirators distributed tampered medication that posed a health risk to consumers. the scheme targeted brand-name prescription drugs designed to treat hiv, hepatitis c, mental disorders, and various other serious conditions. miller and mic lied to their customers about the nature and sources of the prescription drugs being sold, falsely claiming that the drugs had been maintained in the safe, federally and state-regulated supply chain. the evidence at trial established that miller and his company agreed with many others, including mihran stepanyan, and artur stepanyan, to conduct the affairs of their wide-ranging and long-lasting criminal enterprise. the evidence established that the enterprise, operating primarily out of southern california and minnesota, was responsible for distributing diverted prescription drugs to unsuspecting pharmacies throughout the county. in finding miller guilty, the jury concluded that he played a role in promoting the racketeering conspiracy. for example, as the owner and operator of mic between 2007 and 2015, miller bought approximately $157 million of diverted prescription drugs from codefendants mihran stepanyan and artur stepanayan. miller and mic also knew that the stepanyans were not licensed to sell prescription drugs and that the stepanyans procured their drugs from street suppliers. miller and mic nevertheless purchased the diverted drugs from the stepanyans and lied to their customers about the sources and nature of those drugs.    further, the jury concluded miller engaged in a money laundering conspiracy. the evidence established that miller and others laundered hundreds of millions of dollars between approximately 2007 and 2015 to promote their criminal activities and to conceal the nature of their scheme. for example, to hide the fact miller was paying the stepanyans for the illegally sourced drugs they were distributing, miller made payments to the stepanyans' company gc national wholesale through companies in puerto rico he controlled. as to another supplier, miller authorized payments to accounts held in the names of various front companies at banks in multiple countries. in this way, miller and his co-conspirators sought to obscure the illicit sources of mic drugs and to conceal the true identities of the suppliers.    in sum, at the conclusion of the trial, miller was convicted of one count of racketeering conspiracy, in violation of 18 u.s.c.  1962(d); one count of conspiracy to commit mail, wire, and bank fraud, in violation of 18 u.s.c.  1349; one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 u.s.c.  1956(h); ten counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 u.s.c.  1341; and one count of conspiracy to engage in the unlicensed wholesale distribution of drugs and making false statement to the fda, in violation of 21 u.s.c.  331(t), 333(b)(1)(d), 353(e)(2)(a), and 18 u.s.c.  371.    miller remains out of custody pending sentencing. miller faces a maximum statutory term of life in prison; however, any sentence will be imposed by the court only after consideration of the u.s. sentencing guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 u.s.c.  3553.    the stepanyans and 38 other defendants have pleaded guilty to their respective roles in the conspiracies.    assistant united states attorneys claudia quiroz, andrew dawson, and chris kaltsas are prosecuting the case with the assistance of kevin costello. the prosecution is the result of an investigation by the irs-ci, the fbi, the fda, and uspis. the united states attorney's office notes the extraordinary contributions and commitment of irs-ci special agent bryan wong in this case."

The amount of money involved: N/A (no mention of money involved in the press release).","date:  january 26, 2023    contact:   newsroom@ci.irs.gov    anchorage, ak  filthy fuhrer, formerly timothy lobdell; roy naughton, aka thumper; glen baldwin, aka glen dog; colter o'dell; and craig king, aka oakie, were sentenced this week in alaska to life in prison without the possibility of parole. all five defendants were convicted of racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy in aid of racketeering, murder in aid of racketeering, kidnapping resulting in death, and kidnapping conspiracy. fuhrer and naughton were also each convicted of an additional two counts of kidnapping conspiracy, kidnapping, and assault in aid of racketeering.    evidence presented at trial showed that the defendants were leaders, members, and associates of the 1488s, a violent, prison-based neo-nazi gang that operated inside and outside of state prisons throughout alaska. the 1488s used nazi-derived symbols to identify themselves and their affiliation with the gang, including a 1488 patch tattoo that depicts an iron cross superimposed over a swastika. the tattoo was awarded to members who gained full membership by committing acts of violence on behalf of the gang. the gang enforced discipline through written rules and a code of conduct, including the boast that the only currency we recognize is violence and unquestionable loyalty.    the trial testimony established that fuhrer founded and led the 1488 gang from inside a maximum-security prison, where he was serving a 19-year sentence for the attempted murder of an alaska state trooper. in addition to directing acts of violence aimed at establishing the gang's dominance in the prison hierarchy, fuhrer ordered members of the gang to commit violent kidnappings and assaults in the free world outside of prison. as part of a plan to impose greater organization and structure among non-incarcerated members, fuhrer insisted on punishing members that he perceived to be defying the 1488 code of conduct thereby diminishing the power, influence, and reputation of the gang. fuhrer sent out a trusted lieutenant with a list of directives, which culminated in the kidnapping and assault of two lower-level gang members on april 2, 2017, and july 20, 2017, and the kidnapping, assault, and murder of michael staton on aug. 3, 2017.    according to the trial evidence, on april 2, 2017, defendant roy naughton and other 1488 members, acting at the direction of fuhrer, lured a victim to a gang meeting at naughton's residence. once there, the victim was taken into a basement where he was held at gun point, tied up, and assaulted. as part of the assault, the gang members shattered a lightbulb in his mouth and tattooed him with a racial epithet. the victim was threatened with more violence if the incident was reported to police.    in addition, the evidence at trial demonstrated that on july 17, 2017, fuhrer called naughton from prison. during the call naughton boasted about the april 2 assault and reported to fuhrer that another member would be assaulted in the next few days. on july 20, 2017, a second victim was similarly assaulted and had his 1488 membership patch burned off.    evidence also showed that in 2016 naughton asked for and received permission from fuhrer to impose exceptionally severe discipline on 1488 member michael staton, who held himself out as a member of the hells angels motorcycle club, for stealing from both the 1488's and defendant craig king. naughton, king, and defendants glen baldwin and colter o'dell worked with other 1488 members to locate, kidnap, and murder staton. on august 3, 2017, 1488 members, including baldwin and o'dell, lured staton to wasilla where they beat him and took him to king's duplex. after arriving, staton was taken to an empty room which had been lined with plastic sheeting. inside the room king and the 1488s beat and tortured the victim, including cutting off his 1488 tattoo with a knife that had been heated with a propane torch. the defendants wrapped staton in the plastic and carpeting, and baldwin and o'dell drove him to a remote section of wasilla where they shot him and set fire to his body. o'dell was awarded full membership in 1488s for his role in the murder.    the united states attorney's office will use every tool at its disposal to combat and dismantle violent criminal enterprises, said u.s. attorney s. lane tucker for the district of alaska. these life sentences reflect the seriousness of the defendants' conduct in the maiming of two individuals and the brutal murder of a third, all in order to strengthen their hate-based criminal enterprise. we will continue to work tirelessly with our federal, state and local investigative partners to ensure those engaging in such loathsome crimes are caught and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.    with federal life sentences imposed on five defendants who were associated with a violent, hate-driven gang, alaska's law enforcement community has delivered a devastating blow to the 1488 criminal enterprise, said special agent in charge antony jung of the fbi anchorage field office. dismantling violent, criminal organizations is a priority for the fbi, and a goal that is shared among our law enforcement and prosecution partners across alaska.    the fbi's safe streets task force, and the alaska state troopers, alaska bureau of investigation, investigated the case in conjunction with the u.s. attorney's office for the district of alaska and the

stephanie m. hinds, internal revenue service-criminal investigation (irs-ci) special agent in charge darren lian, and federal bureau of investigation special agent in charge robert k. tripp,.    santos, of san francisco, was originally charged in a federal complaint on may 11, 2020, with bank fraud. santos, a licensed civil and structural engineer, was the co-founder and a principal of the san francisco-based company santos and urrutia structural engineers, inc (s&u). his business provided engineering services and managed the process of obtaining building permits from municipal authorities for his clients. the complaint described that santos was appointed in 2000 as a member of the san francisco building inspection commission by then mayor willie brown and was promoted in 2004 to be the commission's president by mayor gavin newsom. mayor ed lee appointed santos in 2012 to the san francisco city college board of trustees.    an indictment (cr 21-268 si) followed the complaint and charged santos with committing bank fraud and with providing false records to the fbi in its investigation, among other charges. a grand jury thereafter issued a second, separate indictment (cr 21-453 si) against santos, charging him with honest services fraud for repeatedly soliciting donations from his clients to a favored non-profit athletic association of a san francisco senior building inspector to obtain favorable treatment for the clients from the building inspector. santos was most recently further charged by an information (cr 22-345 si) with five counts of tax evasion for the tax years 2015 through 2019.    today santos pleaded guilty in indictment (cr 21-268 si) to ten counts of bank fraud involving the commission of fraud against his own clients and his business. in his plea agreement, santos described that from 2012 to 2019 he engaged in a scheme in which he collected numerous checks from his clients that they made payable to san francisco's municipal agencies, including the department of building inspection (dbi) and the department of public works, to private companies and to individuals. santos led his clients to believe these checks would be used to pay the fees or costs of their building projects. santos instead deposited the checks into his personal bank account. to do so, he either fraudulently altered the checks by editing the pay to the order of section of the checks to appear as if the checks had been written to him personally or he fraudulently endorsed the checks to himself by signing the back of the check on behalf of the payee. by depositing the checks into his personal bank account, he obtained his clients' funds for himself. santos admitted that from 2012 to 2019 he deposited approximately 445 checks of his clients' checks into his personal bank account and fraudulently obtained more than $775,000 of his clients' money.    santos also admitted that from 2012 to 2018 he fraudulently deposited into his personal bank account approximately 378 checks written as pay to the order of s&u, his engineering firm. by depositing theses checks into his personal account, santos admitted that he caused a loss to s&u of more than $718,000.    santos further pleaded guilty in the same indictment to falsifying records in a federal investigation. santos described in his plea agreement that on march 2, 2020, two fbi agents served him with a grand jury subpoena requesting documents related to six client checks connected to the above-described fraud schemes. in response, santos altered s&u invoices to make it falsely appear that his clients had been credited for the checks, though santos had fraudulently deposited them into his own personal bank account and had never credited his clients for those checks. he admitted that he forwarded the falsified invoices to the fbi knowing they were false and intending to obstruct the fbi's investigation.    in the second indictment (cr 21-453 si), santos pleaded guilty today to one count of honest services wire fraud. in his plea agreement, santos admitted he engaged in a scheme to defraud the public of the honest services of his co-defendant bernard currie, who was a senior building inspector at dbi. santos knew curran supported and favored a local non-profit athletic organization. santos, intending to influence curran in the performance of his official duties, arranged for his clients to make charitable contributions to the non-profit athletic organization. santos ensured curran knew about these donations by either personally delivering the clients' checks to curran or by otherwise informing him of the donations. santos described that his clients received favorable official treatment from curran on their projects in exchange for the donations. in total, from 2017 to 2020 santos arranged for 13 of his clients to make a total of $9,600 in donations to the non-profit athletic association, and all 13 clients received at least on one official action from curran in his capacity as a dbi senior building inspector.    in the third case against santos (cr 21-345 si), santos today pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion. santos admitted that from 2012 to 2019 he deposited more than $1.6 million into his personal account and that he deliberately omitted this income on his tax returns for the tax years 2012 to 2019, thereby evading taxes. santos admitted the source of the $1.6 million in unreported income was the above-described bank fraud scheme through which santos fraudulently deposited 823 client checks into his personal bank account. santos further admitted that he willfully submitted false and fraudulent tax forms for each year from 2012 to 2019, resulting in a tax avoidance of more than $564,000.    santos entered his guilty pleas today before united states district judge susan illston, who scheduled a sentencing hearing for santos on june 23, 2023. santos remains out of custody pending his sentencing hearing.    in summary, santos pleaded guilty to ten counts of bank fraud, one count of honest services wire fraud, one count of falsifying records in a federal investigation, and five counts of tax evasion. each count of bank fraud in violation of 18 u.s.c.  1344 carries a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. the count of honest services wire fraud in violation of 18 u.s.c.  1343 and 1346

result is proof that the criminal division and our law enforcement partners will never stop pursuing cybercriminals who target the american publicno matter where these criminals reside, and no matter

u.s. attorney carlton s. shier iv for the eastern district of kentucky. to continue to protect americans against organized cybercrime, cooperation and coordination among law enforcement is essential.

work done by all our law enforcement partners, and we are proud to have joined this cooperative effort to prosecute this significant cyber fraud scheme.    financial crimes that take place in the

committed to investigating such crimes, and we appreciate the continued support of our local, state, federal, and international law enforcement partners as we work together to bring those responsible to justice.    according to plea documents, beginning as early as october 2014, sandu and other members of the criminal organization collectively developed a process and offered a service by which co-conspirators based in the united states and abroad would launder the proceeds of online auction fraud.    according to court documents, georgescu, filip, and other co-conspirators posted false advertisements to popular online auction and sales websites, such as ebay, for goods that did not actually exist. members of the conspiracy created fictitious online accounts to post these advertisements and communicate with victims, sometimes using the stolen identities of americans to do so. the advertisements typically marketed the sale of used vehicles or similar goods and targeted working-class americans.    members of the conspiracy used several tactics to convince victims to send money for the advertised goods. for example, they impersonated a military member who needed to sell the advertised item before deployment. in furtherance of the scheme, the defendants delivered invoices to the victims bearing trademarks of reputable companies to make the transaction appear legitimate. the defendants also set up call centers to impersonate customer support, address questions, and alleviate concerns over the advertisements.    once victims had sent payment, members of the conspiracy engaged in a complex money laundering scheme offered by sandu and others wherein u.s.-based conspirators received victim funds, converted those funds to cryptocurrency, and transferred proceeds in the form of cryptocurrency to foreign-based money launderers. those foreign-based money launderers, such as cucu and calin, would then work with other members of the conspiracy to convert the bitcoin back into fiat currency. sandu was held responsible for laundering over $3.5 million worth of fraudulent proceeds. to date, law enforcement has identified over 900 victims of this scheme.    the investigation was conducted by irs criminal investigation, u.s. secret service, kentucky state police, lexington police department, and u.s. postal inspection service, and supported by the justice department's organized crime drug enforcement task force (ocdetf) and the international organized crime intelligence and operations center (ioc-2). assistance was provided by the romanian

california (usc), the university of texas, wake forest and yale  was sentenced today in federal court in boston.    william rick singer, of st. petersburg, florida., formerly of newport beach, california, was sentenced by u.s. district court senior judge rya w. zobel to 42 months in prison and three years of supervised release. singer was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $10,668,841 to the internal revenue service and to forfeit specific assets with a value in excess of $5.3 million and approximately $3.4 million in the form of a forfeiture money judgment. in march 2019, singer pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the united states and obstruction of justice.    rick singer was the architect of a sprawling criminal enterprise that corrupted the admissions process at several of the nation's most elite universities. his decade-long scheme resembled something out of a hollywood movie. he courted the entitled, rich and famous, who were so desperate for their children to secure college admission, that they lied, cheated and bribed to get them in, said united states attorney rachael s. rollins. while this historic case generated headlines around the globe with privilege, celebrity and entitlement at its core, it also exposed the profound failings in the college admissions process. there should not be a separate college admissions process for the rich, powerful and entitled. this case exposed that there is. but it also resulted in meaningful changes in the college admissions process and i am incredibly proud of that.    access to a quality education is a key pillar of our society and the american institutions that are educating our future leaders are second to none. but maintaining fairness in the access to these great institutions is also a vital part of this system, said joleen d. simpson, special agent in charge of the internal revenue service's criminal investigations in boston. today's sentence should send a clear message and serve as a deterrent to those who might contemplate similar fraudulent schemes.    rick singer was the mastermind of a massive criminal enterprise that undermined the college admissions process at universities all across the country. fueled by pure and simple greed, mr. singer raked in millions of dollars in his corrupt scheme in which he rigged the system, making it much easier for far less qualified students and their families to buy their way into some of this country's most elite universities. with every bribe he paid, he sold out hardworking students a little more. there is no question the damage he has done is profound and today's sentence shows that there are significant consequences for his criminal conduct, said joseph r. bonavolonta, special agent in charge of the federal bureau of investigation, boston division. operation varsity blues uncovered a bold and shameless decade-long scheme that undercut hard-working students trying to get into these prestigious universities the right way. everyone we've arrested, charged, and convicted to date were integral to the scheme's success, but without rick singer, they never would have succeeded.    today's action shows that mr. singer abused his position to help scores of parents cheat their way through the college admissions process. in doing so, he damaged the reputation of the schools and hurt legitimate students who sought admission to those schools. that is unacceptable, said terry harris, special agent in charge of the u.s. department of education office of inspector general eastern regional office.    singer owned and operated the edge college & career network llc (the key)  a for-profit college counseling and preparation business  and served as the ceo of the key worldwide foundation (kwf)  a non-profit corporation that he established as a purported charity to provide educational and self-enrichment programs for disadvantaged youth.    between approximately 2011 and february 2019, singer conspired with dozens of parents, athletic coaches, a university athletics administrator, and others, to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of students to colleges and universities including georgetown, stanford, ucla, usc, the university of texas, wake forest and yale. the conspiracy involved paying off test proctors and administrators to permit cheating on college entrance exams and bribing university athletic coaches and administrators to designate applicants as purported athletic recruits based on fabricated credentials.    singer facilitated cheating on the sat and act exams for his clients by instructing them to seek extended time for their children on college entrance exams, which often involved having the children purport to have learning disabilities in order to obtain the required medical documentation. once the extended time was granted, singer instructed the clients to change the location of the exams to a test center where corrupt test proctors took the exams in place of the students, gave the students the correct answers during the exams, or corrected the students' answers after they completed the exams, and corrupt test administrators permitted the cheating to occur. in many instances, the students taking the exams were unaware that their parents had arranged for the cheating.    singer also accepted payments from parents to bribe coaches and university athletics administrators to designate their children as purported athletic recruits, regardless of their athletic experience or abilities. as part of the scheme, singer directed his associates to create falsified athletic profiles for the students, which were then submitted to the university admissions offices in support of the students' applications. the profiles included fake athletic honors and, in some instances, staged or photoshopped photos purporting to show the students engaged in athletic activity.    to conceal the scheme, singer used the key worldwide foundation to disguise bribe payments as purported charitable contributions, thereby enabling clients to deduct the bribes from their federal income taxes. in total, singer accepted more than $25 million from his clients as part of the scheme  of which he paid bribes totaling more than $7 million and transferred, spent, or otherwise used more than $15 million for his own benefit.    in total, 55 defendants were charged for their involvement in singer's exam cheating and athletic recruitment conspiracy. of those, 53 were convicted  either by guilty plea or jury conviction following trial. one defendant received a presidential pardon and one defendant entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the government. to date, the government has collected $8,880,802 in forfeiture from seized bank accounts, real estate and voluntary payments, $5,682,954 in fines and $96,960 in restitution. for more information on defendants charged in the conspiracy, please visit the united states attorney's office, district of massachusetts,  investigations of college admissions and

respectively. he also stated that his father had done this for years before he had taken over butch's operations and that his father used business a to cash checks for 30-35 years. ercin continued to explain the conspiracy by informing the undercover agent that he regularly cashed $50,000-60,000 at a time in off the books checks at business a but estimated that he had reduced the amounts in recent years to approximately $30,000 to $35,000 cashed per visit to business a. ercin also informed the agent that lizette also reported sizeable w-2 income, which helped them evade scrutiny by the irs.    while working with the outside tax preparation and accounting agency, lizette deliberately hid the money flowing through business a. lizette sent bank statements for the corporate accounts, check stubs, credit card statements, payroll records, and other business records but withheld the revenue received through the checks cashed at business a. thus, underreporting taxable income to the tax preparation and accounting agency.    during conversations with the undercover agent, lizette showed records to the undercover agent displaying total sales of $4.3 million and $3.9 million for the fiscal years 2017 and 2018. lizette also talked about pulling out invoices for additional customers from business records to cause business records to match their bank records.    as detailed in their plea agreements, the kalenders knowingly caused a portion of the employee's wages to be paid in cash and falsely reported the wages of butch's employees on forms 941 filed with irs. in a conversation with the undercover agent, ercin stated that he paid all his employees' extra compensation in cash to avoid tax obligations except for one secretary who was not paid under the table. this system of paying employees in cash deprived the state of maryland of tax revenue and subverted the taxation systems of the irs and maryland. in 2019, after the kalenders became aware of the irs's investigation, butch's reported gross receipts of more than $4.5 million, an increase of more than $2.2 million over the fiscal year 2018.    united states attorney erek l. barron commended the irs-ci for their work in the investigation. mr. barron thanked assistant u.s. attorney harry m. gruber, who prosecuted the case."

The amount of money involved: Victims lost over $16 million.,"date:  june 30, 2022    contact:   newsroom@ci.irs.gov    damian williams, the united states attorney for the southern district of new york, announced that christopher wright and steven hooper were sentenced to 52 months in prison and 42 months in prison, respectively, for defrauding elderly victims in connection with the fraudulent sale of stock and fake carbon credits as part of an over $16 million international telemarketing scheme. wright and hooper previously pled guilty before u.s. district judge jed s. rakoff, who imposed the sentences.    according to the allegations in the indictment, court filings, and statements made in court:    from in or about 2009 up to and including in or about 2015, wright, hooper, and other co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to defraud victims in the united kingdom through the sale of false, fraudulent, and materially misleading investments, and to launder the proceeds of the fraud through bank accounts in the united states and foreign countries. wright and hooper used the services of telemarketing call centers to identify and cold-call potential victims, who were primarily elderly or retired individuals residing in the united kingdom. over a series of telephone calls, the telemarketers persuaded victims to invest money under various false and misleading pretenses, including the promise of short-term, high-yield, no-risk returns, when in fact the investments were high-risk, illiquid, and in some instances, entirely fictitious. many victims were persuaded to make additional investments under the false pretense that they would not be permitted to sell their holdings until they purchased more. in reliance on the false representations and promises, the victims wired funds to various bank accounts in the united states, including in the southern district of new york, in the names of corporate entities controlled by one of wright's and hooper's co-conspirators. wright and hooper assisted in emailing of documents related to the fraudulent investments, including purchase contracts and investment certificates, to the victims. victims who tried to sell their investments found they were unable to do so. the victims never received a refund on their principal or any return on their investments.    in order to conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of the proceeds of the fraudulent scheme, wright, hooper, and their co-conspirators set up overseas bank accounts, including in cyprus, switzerland, and the united kingdom, in the names of various shell companies, which were used to launder a substantial portion of the fraud proceeds.    the nature of the particular fraudulent investment vehicles being marketed to the victims changed over time. from in or about 2009 until in or about 2011, wright and his co-conspirators sold the stock of florida-based corporation directview holdings, inc. (directview) to the victims based on telemarketers' false representations and promises that the shares were a no-risk, short-term investment in a debt-free company, and that the shares were likely to increase over 100 percent in value in a short period of time. in fact, directview's annual report filed with the united states securities and exchange commission (sec) for the year ending december 31, 2010, contained dire warnings about the poor fiscal health of directview and the risk attendant in purchasing stock, including that the company may be forced to cease operations due to losses and cash flow problems, and purchasers may find it extremely difficult or impossible to resell our shares.    from in or about 2011 until in or about 2015, wright, hooper, and their co-conspirators engaged in the sale of fraudulent carbon credits. the boiler room callers appealed to victims by claiming that the investments would be environmentally friendly and help address the climate crisis. carbon credits, which are issued as part of governmental and voluntary regulatory regimes, are permits representing the right to emit a certain number of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. carbon offsets, which are tied to particular carbon-dioxide emissions reducing projects, represent a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and can be purchased by individuals and companies to offset their or third parties' carbon-footprints. the victims were falsely promised that the carbon-related investments they purchased could be easily sold, carried no risk, and would yield a significant, short-term return. in fact, the carbon credits and offsets that were sold to the victims were fake, and did not represent any actual carbon credits or offsets.    in total, victims lost over $16 million.    in addition to their prison terms, wright and hooper who are both citizens of the united kingdom, were ordered to pay restitution in the respective amounts of $16,407,459.52 and $14,457,104.19. wright and hooper were also ordered to pay forfeiture in the amount of $1,632,443.10 and $760,977.12, respectively.    mr. williams praised the outstanding investigative work of irs criminal investigation in this case.    this case is being prosecuted by the office's money laundering and transnational criminal enterprises and complex frauds and cybercrime units. assistant u.s. attorneys jessica feinstein, olga i. zverovich, and david felton are in charge of the prosecution."

'stronger through partnership' is the ocdetf motto, and the success of this highly impactful investigation truly exemplifies that motto, noted ryan l. korner, special agent in charge of the los angeles field office of irs-criminal investigation (irs-ci). the primary motivation of drug traffickers is greed. they don't care how their actions negatively impact innocent people, the community, or our society. the role of irs-ci is to fully dismantle these criminal organizations by following the money that fuels the drug trade, and ultimately ensure that the peddlers of these illicit drugs do not reap the benefits of their criminal activity.    the fbi is committed to keeping our communities safe from the vast array of violent crimes and criminal activity which accompanies these illegal establishments, said fbi special agent in charge stacey moy. i want to thank our law enforcement partners at the san diego county sheriff's department, the san diego police department, the chula vista police department, the internal revenue service, the united states attorney's office for the southern district of california, and the san diego county district attorney's office for their commitment and collaboration on these cases. it's these ongoing partnerships which enable law enforcement from around the county to be agile and able to handle these types of cases using a variety of investigative techniques with different prosecutive options.    the sheriff's department has been a proud partner in the collaborative law enforcement response to organized criminal activity related to unlicensed marijuana distribution in the east county, said kelly a. martinez, undersheriff of the san diego county sheriff's department. sheriff deputies, investigators, and analysts committed countless hours of investigative support, surveillance, and analysis to this effort. today's outcome is a culmination of the dedication of federal, state, and local law enforcement partnerships in the region which are the hallmark of public safety in san diego. east san diego county is safer today because of this hard work.    this operation demonstrates that strong partnerships, including participating on federal task forces, keeps our community safe, said san diego police department chief david nisleit. the san diego police department is committed to working with neighboring law enforcement agencies to combat organized crime in our region. we are proud of the work that has been done to close these illegal distribution centers and stop the violent crime associated with them.    illegal marijuana dispensaries have been responsible for numerous complaints by our community members, added chula vista police department chief roxana kennedy. we've seen many of them open up near our schools over time. they pose a significant health and safety hazard to the public, especially our youth, and they move around trying to avoid enforcement. collaborating with our law enforcement partners in the region and pooling our resources to stop these criminal organizations from putting our communities at risk is absolutely critical.    to date, law enforcement has executed dozens of search warrants and charged more than 30 individuals with violating state and federal law. as a result of this joint effort, law enforcement has seized nearly 30,000 pounds of marijuana and marijuana products; 68 firearms, including ghost guns; and millions of dollars in currency, jewelry, and other valuables. nearly 30 unlicensed, illegal marijuana dispensaries and wholesale distributors have been shut down as a result.    of those who have been charged, two groups of individuals recently pleaded guilty in federal court besides sheikhan and williams.    the first group, headed by lance kachi, admitted to operating multiple unlicensed, illegal marijuana dispensaries in spring valley and el cajon, including locations at 9545 campo road, 9600 campo road, 9070 jamacha road, 985 greenfield drive, and 9143 birch street. since at least 2020, kachi, michael yono, avrin yakou, fabian yakou, and others, oversaw multiple unlicensed dispensaries that would each generate up to $25,000 daily, and were open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.    kachi and his coconspirators grossed millions of dollars in revenue from their illegal, unlicensed operation. several times a week, kachi and others would meet at various hotels where they would spend hours counting hundreds of thousands of dollars in dispensary proceeds using automated money counters. before leaving the room with bags of money, the defendants would pack up their money counters as well as the various notes they took to account for their profits and expenses, such as the cost of armed security.    in july 2021, law enforcement executed multiple search warrants targeting the kachi operation. in may 2022, kachi, yono, and the yakou brothers pleaded guilty to various drug, firearms, and money laundering charges, as well as the forfeiture of millions of dollars in cash, jewelry, and other valuables.    also in may 2022, a second group, comprised of the shamoun brothers  sean, alvin, vincent, and andrew  pleaded guilty in federal court to charges stemming from their wholesale distribution of marijuana products to unlicensed, illegal marijuana dispensaries from los angeles to san diego. operating under the name of babylon's garden, the shamoun brothers manufactured a variety of marijuana products at a warehouse in san diego, which they would deliver directly to dispensaries or ship in the united states mail. the shamoun brothers admitted that their operation was responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of more than 3,000 kilograms of marijuana.    in their plea agreements, all the various defendants referenced above admitted that they had an obligation to report their income to both the internal revenue service (irs) and california state tax authorities, as well as pay taxes on any income derived from these illegal businesses, which they failed to do. additionally, all individuals agreed to forfeit seized cash, which currently exceeds $5 million.    this case is the result of ongoing efforts by the organized crime drug enforcement task force (ocdetf), a partnership that brings together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. the principal mission of the ocdetf program is to identify, disrupt, dismantle and prosecute high-level members of drug trafficking, weapons trafficking and money

(cam), was qualified to compete for and obtain government contracts set aside for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. while cam's organizing documents supported rice's assertion that it was owned by a service-disabled veteran and that it qualified for the contracts, investigation revealed that the business was not, in fact, qualified. rice, who is not a service-disabled veteran, actually controlled the business. and she willfully made the false certifications to make the business seem eligible for the government contracts.    the defendant made her false statements in the system for award management, which is a database for federal contractors operated by the general services administration. contractors must certify that they are qualified to compete for and receive federal procurement contracts in the system. in addition, contractors must annually certify their continued eligibility for government contracts set aside for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses.    on behalf of cam, rice submitted bids on commissary contracts at two military bases. both contracts were set aside for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. cam was awarded the contracts, which had a combined value of over $11 million over five years, and tax returns showed that rice earned $480,039 from cam between 2012 and 2019.    in addition to the 14-month sentence, senior u.s. district judge bill r. wilson, from the eastern district of arkansas, sitting by designation, ordered rice to pay the $480,039 she reported earning from cam in restitution to the department of defense and to serve three years of supervised release following her prison sentence. rice pleaded guilty to the charge on april 12, 2022.    service-disabled veterans deserve better than to lose out on government contracts because someone else cheats the system, said u.s. attorney josh hurwit. our office will vigorously investigate and prosecute those who unlawfully subvert the government contracting process for their own personal gain.    fraudulent schemes such as this fleece the government and deserving veterans who served our country, said special agent in charge terry pfeifer of the gsa office of inspector general. gsa oig will continue working with law enforcement partners to combat federal contract fraud.    this case demonstrates the commitment of the department of defense office of inspector general's defense criminal investigative service (dcis), along with our law enforcement partners, to aggressively pursuing those who undermine the integrity of government-sponsored small business initiatives, said michael mentavlos, special agent in charge of dcis's southwest field office. individuals who engage in activity that deprives legitimate program participants of valuable economic opportunities will be thoroughly investigated and held accountable.    falsifying documents to gain access to sba program funds intended for the nation's small businesses is reprehensible, said sba oig's western region special agent in charge weston king. our office will remain relentless in the pursuit of fraudsters who seek to exploit sba's vital economic programs. i want to thank the u.s. attorney's office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and commitment to seeing justice served.    u.s. attorney hurwit, of the district of idaho, made the announcement and commended the following agencies for cooperative efforts that led to the prosecution of this case: the internal revenue service criminal investigations, the general services administration office of inspector general, the department of defense office of inspector general, the small business administration office of inspector general."

This suspect's criminal activity is: not mentioned in the press release. The result of this case: The distribution of approximately $92 million in compensation for losses suffered by FIFA, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, and various national soccer federations. The amount of money involved: Approximately $92 million.","date:  june 30, 2022    contact:  newsroom@ci.irs.gov    the department of justice announced today a further distribution of approximately $92 million in compensation for losses suffered by fifa, the world organizing body of soccer; concacaf, the confederation responsible for soccer governance in north and central america, among other jurisdictions; conmebol, the confederation responsible for soccer governance in south america; and various constituent national soccer federations (collectively, the victims). the funds, which were remitted following the department's recognition of losses and grant of remission up to a total of $201 million in august 2021, were forfeited to the united states in the eastern district of new york as part of the government's long-running investigation and prosecution of corruption in international soccer. to date, the prosecutions have resulted in charges against more than 50 individual and corporate defendants from more than 20 countries, primarily in connection with the offer and receipt of bribes and kickbacks paid by sports marketing companies to soccer officials in exchange for the media and marketing rights to various soccer tournaments and events and the laundering of those payments.    breon peace, united states attorney for the eastern district of new york, kenneth a. polite, jr., assistant attorney general of the justice department's criminal division, ryan l. korner, special agent-in-charge, internal revenue service-criminal investigation, los angeles (irs-ci), and michael j. driscoll, assistant director-in-charge, federal bureau of investigation, new york field office (fbi) made the announcement.    today's distribution of approximately $92 million underscores our commitment to returning money obtained through the corruption and fraud prosecuted in this case to the victims, where it will be used to benefit the sport, stated united states attorney peace. over much of the past decade, this investigation and prosecution has concentrated on bringing wrongdoers to justice and recovering ill-gotten gains. our office, working in collaboration with our law enforcement partners and colleagues in the department of justice, will continue our work to compensate victims of crime.    from the beginning of the fifa investigation and prosecutions, one of the department's primary goals has been to make the victims whole, stated assistant attorney general polite. the department has used every tool at its disposal to make this a reality, while depriving the perpetrators of the proceeds of their crimes. this distribution of approximately $92 million as compensation for losses suffered highlights the importance of asset forfeiture as a critical tool in this endeavor.    as the distributions to victims have demonstrated, irs-ci and our law enforcement partners will leave no stones unturned when it comes to conducting investigations involving financial crimes, stated irs-ci special agent-in-charge korner. not only have dozens of individuals been brought to justice through the course of the investigation, but the additional $92 million will be returned in full to the victims to help compensate them for the injuries caused by this corruption.    there was an extraordinary amount of money flowing between corrupt officials and businesses in this massive scheme, stated fbi assistant director-in-charge driscoll. it is gratifying to know assets seized from the criminals involved will be distributed to groups in need of the money, one specifically focused on educating and safeguarding football for women and girls. the silver lining is that some good will come from the rampant greed uncovered in this investigation.    on may 27, 2015, an indictment was unsealed charging 14 fifa officials and sports marketing executives with racketeering, honest services wire fraud and money laundering offenses, among others. on december 3, 2015, a superseding indictment was unsealed charging an additional 16 fifa officials with similar crimes. during the course of the prosecutions, 27 individual defendants have pleaded guilty to their roles in the charged crimes. in december 2017, two former fifa officials, juan ngel napout and jose maria marin, were convicted after trial of racketeering conspiracy and related offenses. four corporate entities have pleaded guilty and others, including banks, have acknowledged their roles in criminal conduct through deferred prosecution or non-prosecution agreements.    as part of these proceedings, many of the defendants were ordered to forfeit assets obtained through their criminal activity. under federal law, the department of justice has the authority to distribute the proceeds of forfeited assets through the remission process to victims of crimes, including to the soccer organizations that employed and were defrauded by the corrupt soccer executives.    fifa, concacaf, and conmebol have committed to distributing funds received through the remission process, including $32.3 million previously remitted in august 2021, to and through a newly created world football remission fund (the fund) focused on women's/girl's football, education, safeguarding, youth programs, community outreach and humanitarian needs. the fund has been established under the fifa foundation, an independent foundation that uses soccer, and sport in general, as a tool for social development. the terms of the fund provide for oversight and independent audit measures to ensure remitted funds are distributed appropriately.    assistant u.s. attorneys samuel p. nitze, m. kristin mace, brian d. morris, kaitlin t. farrell, and victor a. zapana are in charge of the prosecution and the petition, solicitation, and providing recommendations on the victims' petitions. assistant u.s. attorney lauren h. elbert and trial attorney christian nauvel and former trial attorney michael grady of the money laundering and asset recovery section joined in the investigation and prosecution of the banks.    the justice department, through the asset forfeiture program, works diligently to restore lost funds to victims of crime. the victim compensation payments in the fifa case would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts of the u.s. department of justice criminal division's money laundering and asset recovery section, which reviewed and approved the victims' petition for remission; the fbi's new york field office; and the internal revenue service-criminal investigation."

lies about the profit potential and by artfully creating an illusion that he was well-connected and a proven success, said assistant director in charge kristi johnson of the fbi's los angeles field office. while cryptocurrency investments can be alluring to those seeking the latest opportunity, caution is warranted as the fraud associated with decentralized money investments is pervasive.

"The suspect is: Eugeni Tsvetnenko. This criminal case happened in: the southern district of New York and starting from: at least in or about 2012 through in or about 2013.

The result of this case: Eugeni Tsvetnenko was sentenced to 98 months in prison. The amount of money involved: The fraudulent scheme defrauded mobile phone users of approximately $41.3 million and netted Tsvetnenko and his co-conspirators more than $20 million in proceeds. Tsvetnenko personally earned approximately $15.4 million in connection with the scheme, which he repaid prior to sentencing.","date:  june 28, 2022    contact:   newsroom@ci.irs.gov    damian williams, the united states attorney for the southern district of new york, announced today that eugeni tsvetnenko, a/k/a zhenya, a dual citizen of australia and russia, was sentenced to 98 months in prison by u.s. district judge analisa torres. tsvetnenko pled guilty on february 18, 2022, for his role in a consumer fraud scheme to charge mobile phone customers millions of dollars in monthly fees for unsolicited, recurring text messages about topics such as horoscopes, celebrity gossip, and trivia facts, without the customers' knowledge or consenta practice referred to as auto-subscribing. the portion of the fraudulent scheme that tsvetnenko and his co-conspirators orchestrated defrauded mobile phone users of approximately $41.3 million and netted tsvetnenko and his co-conspirators more than $20 million in proceeds. tsvetnenko personally earned approximately $15.4 million in connection with the scheme, which he repaid prior to sentencing.    u.s. attorney damian williams said: eugeni tsvetnenko and his co-defendants made a fortune by fraudulently charging their customers for text messages they didn't need or approve, in a practice called 'auto-subscribing,' then laundering the proceeds through shell companies. tsvetnenko is paying a steep price for his mobile scam, as he has already paid back over $15 million in forfeiture, and will now spend 98 months in federal prison.    according to allegations in the superseding indictment against tsvetnenko, evidence presented at the trial of co-conspirators darcy wedd (wedd) and fraser thompson (thompson), and other public filings:    from at least in or about 2012 through in or about 2013, tsvetnenko, wedd, thompson, and others engaged in a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud consumers by placing unauthorized charges for premium text messaging services on consumers' cellular phone bills through a practice known as auto-subscribing. tsvetnenko owned and operated several content provider companies and mobile industry companies in australia that, among other things, created and sold premium text messaging content to consumers. wedd operated mobile messenger, a u.s. aggregation company in the mobile phone industry that served as a middleman between content providers (such as some of tsvetnenko's companies) and mobile phone carriers. mobile messenger was responsible for assembling monthly charges incurred by a particular mobile phone customer for premium text-messaging services and placing those charges on that customer's cellular phone bill.    beginning in or about early 2012, wedd, thompson, who was the senior vice president of strategic operations for mobile messenger, and two other senior executives of mobile messenger (cc-3 and cc-4) recruited tsvetnenko to their auto-subscribing scheme to increase revenues at mobile messenger. tsvetnenko agreed and established two new content providers based in australia, cf enterprises and digimobi, to auto-subscribe on mobile messenger's aggregation platform. cc-3 furnished lists of phone numbers to tsvetnenko, along with an auto-subscribing playbook, which provided tsvetnenko with guidance on how to auto-subscribe without being caught. the playbook described how to conceal the fraud scheme by making it appear as if the customers had, in fact, elected to purchase the text-messaging services, when in truth they had not.    the consumers who received the unsolicited text messages typically ignored or deleted the messages, often believing them to be spam. regardless, the consumers were billed for the receipt of the messages, at a rate of $9.99 per month, through charges that typically appeared on the consumers' cellular telephone bills in an abbreviated and confusing form, such as with nonsensical billing descriptors that often consisted of random letter and numbers. the $9.99 charges recurred each month unless and until consumers noticed the charges and took action to unsubscribe. even then, consumers' attempts to dispute the charges and obtain refunds from cf enterprises or digimobi were often unsuccessful. wedd, to whom cc-3, cc-4, and thompson all reported, oversaw the scheme at mobile messenger.    tsvetnenko, with the assistance of wedd, thompson, cc-3, and cc-4, started auto-subscribing consumers in approximately april of 2012. tsvetnenko's auto-subscribing activities, which continued into 2013, victimized hundreds of thousands of mobile phone customers, who were auto-subscribed through mobile messenger and charged a total of approximately $41,389,725 for unwanted text messaging services. wedd, thompson, cc-3, and cc-4 agreed that tsvetnenko would keep approximately 70% of the auto-subscribing proceeds generated by cf enterprises and digimobi, and that the remaining 30% of the auto-subscribing proceeds would be divided evenly among wedd, thompson, cc-3, and cc-4.    after obtaining proceeds of the fraud scheme, tsvetnenko worked with other co-conspirators to launder the proceeds. tsvetnenko and his co-conspirators distributed the proceeds of the fraud scheme among themselves and others involved in the scheme by, among other things, causing funds to be transferred through the bank accounts of a series of shell companies and companies held in the names of third parties. this was done to conceal the nature and source of the payments and tsvetnenko and his co-conspirators' participation in the fraud.    in addition to his prison sentence, tsvetnenko, of australia, was ordered to pay forfeiture in the amount of approximately $15.4 million dollars, which he has repaid.    mr. williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the internal revenue service  criminal investigation and the federal bureau of investigation. in addition, mr. williams thanked law enforcement partners in australia, especially the australian attorney-general department's international crime cooperation central authority and the australian federal police, as well as the u.s. department of justice's office of international affairs, for their significant support and assistance with the defendant's extradition from australia.    the prosecution of this case is being handled by the office's complex frauds and cybercrime unit. assistant u.s. attorneys jilan kamal and olga i. zverovich are in charge of the prosecution."

The suspect is: Paulette Carpoff. This criminal case happened in: Martinez. This suspect's criminal activity is: Paulette Carpoff played a key role in a fraud scheme involving the manufacturing and sale of mobile solar generators. The result of this case: Paulette Carpoff was sentenced to 11 years and three months in prison. The amount of money involved: The fraud scheme defrauded investors of approximately $1 billion.,"date:  june 28, 2022    contact:   newsroom@ci.irs.gov    u.s. district judge john a. mendez sentenced paulette carpoff, of martinez, to 11 years and three months in prison for her role in the biggest criminal fraud scheme in the history of the eastern district of california, u.s. attorney phillip a. talbert announced.    on november 9, 2021, paulette carpoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit an offense against the united states and money laundering. according to court documents, carpoff played a key role in the fraud as chief operating officer of dc solar and the owner and operator of its so-called distribution arm.    between 2011 and 2018, dc solar manufactured mobile solar generators (msg) that were mounted on trailers. the company touted the versatility and environmental sustainability of the mobile solar generators and claimed that they were used to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting and other events. a significant incentive for investors were generous federal tax credits due to the solar nature of the msgs. investors would buy the msgs without ever taking possession of them, paying a percentage of the sales price and financing the balance with dc solar. then the investors leased the msgs back to dc solar, which in turn purported to lease them to third parties. a portion of the lease revenue was supposed to go to the investors and a portion would be used to pay the investors' debts to dc solar.    but in fact, when the thirdparty leases generated little income, the company paid early investors with funds contributed by later investors, and dc solar became a ponzi-like scheme. they sold solar generators that did not exist to investors, making it appear that solar generators existed in locations that they did not, creating false financial statements, and obtaining false lease contracts, among other efforts to conceal the fraud.    in reality, at least half of the approximately 17,000 solar generators claimed to have been manufactured by dc solar did not exist. contrary to what investors were told, approximately 94% of the revenue claimed by dc solar distribution from supposed third-party leasing actually came instead from transfers of new investor cash.    paulette carpoff controlled the ponzi-like payments that hid the company's lack of third-party lease revenue, caused fake engineering reports for msgs that the company sold but never built, and helped fool investors into thinking that dc solar was a success. eventually, dc solar simply stopped building the mobile-solar generators that it claimed to be selling to investors.    while carrying out the fraud, carpoff and her husband enjoyed an excessive accumulation of wealth that included luxury real estate in lake tahoe, las vegas, the caribbean, and cabo san lucas, over 150 luxury and collector vehicles, a private subscription jet service, and lavish jewelry. when search warrants were executed in this case in december 2018, law enforcement found over $18,000 cash in carpoff's purse, another over $18,000 cash in the master bedroom, over $22,000 cash in a safe in the master bedroom closet, and over $9,000 cash in the carpoffs' vehicles parked at their residence.    paulette carpoff played an integral part in a massive criminal fraud scheme. knowing that dc solar at best could only expect to lease a tiny fraction of its mobile solar generators, she continued the lie about the high demand for dc solar's products, said u.s. attorney talbert. thanks to the hard work of attorneys in this office and agents in the investigating agencies, this fraud was stopped and millions of dollars have been recouped. it is my hope that carpoff's sentence will afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and promote respect for the law.    the chief operating officer of dc solar, paulette carpoff, who indulged herself in luxury goods while engaged in lies and deceit, is not an innocent spouse but rather an active conspirator who played a significant and integral role in the largest ponzi scheme in the eastern district of california, said irs criminal investigation special agent in charge mark h. pearson. her lies and deception finally caught up to her, as her hunger to amass ill-gotten wealth and material goods led her astray. today's sentencing sends a clear message of 'you will be held accountable' to those involved in schemes to defraud. this case and the outcome is representation of the great work being accomplished when collaborating with our federal partners: the federal bureau of investigation, the federal depository insurance corporation office of inspector general, and the united states attorney's office, edca.    mrs. carpoff participated in and enjoyed the spoils of an egregious, complex fraud scheme that provided the carpoff family and associates with a luxurious lifestyle and esteemed position in the community at the expense of their community and business contacts, said acting special agent in charge dennis guertin of the fbi sacramento field office. complex cases like these are truly a team effort. i am grateful to the dedicated fbi special agents, forensic accountants and professional staff who worked tirelessly to investigate this case in concert with our equally dedicated partners at irs criminal investigation, fdic office of inspector general, and u.s. attorney's

(fdic oig). the fdic oig is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who undermine the integrity of the nation's financial system.    this case was the product

representative for a member of philadelphia city council, was charged with theft of public money for taking over $27,000 worth of pua benefits. daniels allegedly certified repeatedly that he was

b) garcia or his wife would return a small percentage of the monies paid for the project; and/or c) garcia or his wife would write a personal check to the contracting individual that would be returned by the issuing bank as lacking sufficient funds. on more than one instance, garcia urged the victim not to contact the authorities about the unfinished work.    review of records from bank accounts known to be controlled by garcia and/or his wife for the time period spanning may 2014 through november 2019 indicates that, as a result of the above-described scheme to defraud, garcia obtained a total exceeding $3 million dollars belonging to multiple victims.    further, as reflected in the factual basis filed in support of garcia's guilty plea, garcia and his wife have filed no federal income taxes since 2007, either personally or for their respective businesses. for the tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, garcia and his wife had a joint income exceeding $3 million dollars. in calendar years 2017 and 2018, garcia had and received gross income exceeding the amount required to file an income tax return with the internal revenue service;

conspiracy to commit multiple fraud schemes and filing a false federal income tax return.    tiffany dawn russell was originally indicted in november 2020 for conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, access device fraud, and misuse of a social security number.  according to the indictment, russell and her co-conspirators applied for loans and credit cards with social security numbers that were not issued to them by the social security administration. by doing so, they created new credit profiles or synthetic identities for themselves to open financial accounts and make purchases from retailers without any intention of paying for the items and services obtained. russell was charged with using a synthetic identity to purchase a bmw and to obtain a credit card which she used to pay for her 2016 butt augmentation surgery.    co-conspirators rahne cooper and darius hinton previously pled guilty to committing bank fraud for their illegal use of synthetic identities.    russell agreed to plead guilty to participating in an extensive, multi-year conspiracy to obtain more than $2.5 million from at least 12 financial institutions and the united states small business administration. according to the government, russell used a synthetic identity because she had poor credit. beginning in august 2017, russell embarked on a new scheme, known as credit washing, to remove legitimate debt accounts from her credit history by falsely claiming she was the victim of identity theft and had not opened those accounts. once the credit reporting agencies removed those accounts, her credit score improved, enabling her to obtain credit. she and her unnamed co-conspirators continued to make these false claims of identity theft, demanding the credit reporting agencies remove newly opened accounts. as a result, financial institutions relied on these washed credit reports in deciding whether to extend her credit.    russell also provided fabricated documents when applying for mortgages to purchase three properties, including an oceanfront residence in nags head, north carolina. russell gave doctored bank statements and inflated pay stubs to make it appear she had substantial liquid assets and the ability to pay the loans.    finally, between march 30, 2020 and june 29, 2020, russell and others fraudulently obtained more than $1,000,000 in loans under the cares act, which was enacted by congress to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of americans suffering from the covid-19 pandemic. the ten loan applications, including two for her law firm, contained false representations relating to the number of employees, monthly payroll, revenue, and expenses.    russell used these illegally obtained proceeds to make the down payment on the nags head property and purchase the five other properties in north carolina, maryland and alabama. russell also used these ill-gotten gains to pay outstanding personal debt, unrelated to any business entity.    this case is about a north carolina attorney who funded her lavish lifestyle with an array of frauds, commented u.s. attorney michael easley. she took advantage of the global pandemic to fraudulently secure over a million dollars in covid relief funds, a crime that hurts all taxpayers. the case is also another reminder that it is illegal to defraud banks using so-called credit profile numbers, credit privacy numbers, or credit protection numbers, (cpns) or other tricks. it is a federal crime with the potential to yield years in federal prison. our office will continue to prioritize economic crimes, particularly crimes against taxpayers and government programs intended for those in need.    there is one word that describes the defendant's action: greed, said assistant special agent in charge, brian g. thomas of irs-criminal investigation's charlotte field office. the american tax system is based on a voluntary compliance and the government is designed to provide services to people in need. irs special agents work diligently to identify, investigate, and recommend prosecution on criminals who take advantage of the system. in ms. russell's case, her desire and fraudulent zealous sprees for personal luxuries were obtained by defrauding the system.    tiffany russell's website says, 'she knew at an early age that she had a passion for helping people.' unfortunately, at some point she lost sight of that noble vision and began to help herself to other people's money, including $1 million from the federal cares act intended to help business owners. the fbi and our partners will always work to ensure no one misuses the systems in place to help honest people succeed, said robert r. wells, fbi special agent in charge.    russell pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail, wire and financial institution fraud for which she faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine. she faces an additional three years in prison and $250,000 fine for filing a false tax return. when russell is sentenced during the 4/18/2022 term of court, the court must impose a mandatory restitution order of $2,041,605 to the victim financial institutions, the small business administration and the internal revenue service. as part of her plea agreement, russell consented to the forfeiture of an additional $2,019.571 to the united states.

The result of this case is: Shane Andrew Smith was sentenced to seven years in federal prison and was ordered to pay $59,590,198.82 in restitution. The amount of money involved: $50 million.","date:  january 20, 2022    contact:   newsroom@ci.irs.gov    reagor dykes auto group's chief financial officer, shane andrew smith, was sentenced today to seven years in federal prison for his role in a $50 million wire fraud conspiracy, announced u.s. attorney for the northern district of texas chad e. meacham.    mr. smith pleaded guilty in june 2019 and was sentenced thursday by u.s. district judge matthew j. kacsmaryk, who also ordered him to pay $59,590,198.82 in restitution. the defendant will have to report to prison by 2 p.m. on monday, march 28.    by the time mr. smith was charged in 2019, reagor dykes was a cesspool of criminal schemes, from check kiting to dummy flooring, said u.s. attorney chad meacham. we are proud of the work we've done to hold this defendant  and more than a dozen of his coworkers  accountable for their egregious behavior.    as a corporate executive, mr. smith meticulously conspired to defraud a lending institution, and the resulting loss to the industry was significant, said matthew desarno, special agent in charge of the fbi's dallas division. one of the fbi's goals is to investigate fraud and protect public and investor confidence in our economy, and we will continue that endeavor with our partners.    the defendant was given credit for testifying in the trial of his former boss, reagor dykes owner bart reagor, who was convicted in october of making false statements to an fdic-insured bank. at that trial, mr. smith testified that mr. reagor and his partner, rick dykes, drew roughly $25 million out of the business for personal use, including roughly $3.3 million from a working capital bank loan intended for business use.    prior to testifying against his mr. reagor, mr. smith admitted in plea papers to defrauding the auto group's main lender, ford motor credit company (fmcc), and concealing the fraud by cross-depositing checks across several banks, a ploy known as check-kiting.    in order to cover ballooning expenses, mr. smith admitted, he instructed reagor dykes accountants to engage in a practice they dubbed dummy flooring.    at his direction, accounting staff dug through records for vehicle identification numbers (vin) of cars reagor dykes had already sold, then submitted new loan applications to fmcc using the old vins  falsely indicating that the company was seeking a loan in order to repurchase the vehicle for resale. instead of re-buying the car, however, reagor dykes used the ensuing loan to cover other expenses.    whatever it takes, we need to floor anything and everything we can even think of to cover payoffs each day, mr. smith wrote in an email quoted in his factual resume.    to disguise the shortfall from the dummy flooring scheme, mr. smith and his employees engaged in check-kiting, artificially inflating the company's bank account balances by cross-depositing insufficient checks.    vendor and payroll checks that should have bounced were instead cleared during banks' float time, the period between the deposit in the recipient account and the deduction from the payer's account.    the deposits we do each do [sic] will most likely cover the checks we write each other, mr. smith wrote in an email.    reagor dykes also routinely violated a clause in its loan agreements that required them to repay fmcc within seven days of selling the vehicle for which the loan was issued, mr. smith admitted.    rather than cop to the delay, reagor dykes accountants created false paperwork, which they referred to as dummy shucks, in order to make it appear that the car had been sold more recently.    mr. smith is the fifteenth rdag employee sentenced to more than 37 years combined in federal prison for the dummy flooring and check kiting scheme. reagor dykes employees previously sentenced include:    diana urias, an office manager in reagor dykes' used car mall in levelland, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to

those returns contained false adjustments, false income amounts, or false deductions. eustache included these false items fraudulently to inflate the amount of the taxpayers' refunds. the false items included bogus schedule c losses from businesses, false schedule 1 adjustment to income deductions, false household employee income, and false w-2 wages. the total loss to the irs as a result of the false tax returns filed by eustache was $87,044.    the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security (cares) act is a federal law enacted march 2020. it is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. one source of relief provided by the cares act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the ppp. in april 2020, congress authorized over $300 billion in additional ppp funding.    the ppp allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent. businesses must use ppp loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. the ppp allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if the business spends the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and uses at least a certain percentage of the loan toward payroll expenses.    the eidl program is designed to provide economic relief to small businesses that are currently experiencing a temporary loss of revenue. eidl proceeds can be used to cover a wide array of working capital and normal operating expenses, such as continuation of health care benefits, rent, utilities, and fixed debt payments. if an applicant also obtains a loan under the ppp, the eidl funds cannot be used for the same purpose as the ppp funds.    not only did eustache fraudulently file tax returns on behalf of his clients through his tax preparation business, but he also stole vital ppp loan money intended to support struggling businesses during the covid 19 pandemic, said irs-criminal investigation special agent in charge brian payne. this sentence shows that stopping ppp fraudsters and unscrupulous tax preparers is a top priority for irs-ci. with tax season starting up, taxpayers looking to avoid shady preparers and find tips on how to select a tax preparer are encouraged to visit irs.gov.    this case demonstrates the swift and decisive action taken by the fbi and its federal partners to protect the payment protection program., said special agent in charge of fbi tampa michael mcpherson. we're taking tremendous investigative steps to ensure fraudsters don't profit from the pandemic.    using any sba program fraudulently undermines the spirit and true intent of bolstering the backbone of the nation's economysmall businesses, said sba oig's eastern region special agent in charge amaleka mccall-brathwaite. our office will remain relentless in the pursuit of fraudsters who seek to exploit sba's vital economic programs. i want to thank the u.s. attorney's office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and commitment to seeing justice served. this case was investigated by the internal revenue service, federal bureau of investigation, and the office of inspector general for the small business administration. it was prosecuted by assistant united states attorneys chauncey a. bratt and amanda daniels. the forfeiture and restitution were handled by assistant united states attorneys nicole andrejko and julie simonsen."

special agent in charge darrell j. waldon of the internal revenue service - criminal investigation, washington, d.c. field office; and special agent in charge thomas j. sobocinski of the federal bureau of investigation, baltimore field office.    according to the four-count indictment, on may 26, 2020 and december 29, 2020, mosby submitted 457(b) coronavirus-related distribution requests for one-time withdrawals of $40,000 and $50,000, respectively, from city of baltimore's deferred compensation plans. in each request, the indictment alleges that mosby falsely certified that she met at least one of the qualifications for a distribution as defined under the cares act, specifically, that she experienced adverse financial consequences from the coronavirus as a result of being quarantined, furloughed, or laid off; having reduced work hours; being unable to work due to lack of childcare; or the closing or reduction of hours of a business she owned or operated. in signing the forms, mosby affirm[ed] under penalties for perjury the statements and acknowledgments made in this request. the indictment alleges that mosby did not experience any such financial hardships and in fact, mosby received her full gross salary of $247,955.58 from january 1, 2020 through december 29, 2020, in bi-weekly gross pay direct deposits of $9,183.54.    further, the indictment alleges that on july 28, 2020 and september 2, 2020, as well as on january 14, 2021 and february 19, 2021, mosby made false statements in applications for a $490,500 mortgage to purchase a home in kissimmee, florida and for a $428,400 mortgage to purchase a condominium in long boat key, florida. as part of both applications, mosby was required to disclose her liabilities. mosby did not disclose on either application that she had unpaid federal taxes from a number of previous years and that on march 3, 2020, the internal revenue service (irs) had placed a lien against all property and rights to property belonging to mosby and her husband in the amount of $45,022, the amount of unpaid taxes mosby and her husband owed the irs as of that date. in each application, mosby also responded no in response to the question, are you presently delinquent or in default on any federal debt or any other loan, mortgage, financial obligation, bond, or loan guarantee, even though she was delinquent in paying federal taxes to the irs.    finally, according to the indictment, one week prior to closing on the kissimmee vacation home, on or about august 25, 2020, mosby executed an agreement with a vacation home management company giving the management company control over the rental of the property she ultimately purchased in kissimmee. on september 2, 2020, mosby signed a second home rider which provided, among other things, that the borrower occupy and use the property as their second home; that the borrower maintain exclusive control over the ownership of the property, including short-term rentals, and not subject the property to anyagreement that requires the borrower either to rent the property or give a management firm or any other person or entity any control over the occupancy or use of the property; and that the borrower keep the property available primarily as a residence for their personal use and enjoyment for at least one year, unless the lender otherwise agrees in writing. the indictment alleges that by falsely executing the second home rider mosby could obtain a lower interest rate on the mortgage for the property than she would have received without it.    if convicted, mosby faces a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison for each of two counts of perjury and a maximum of 30 years in federal prison for each of two counts of making false mortgage applications. actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the u.s. sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors.    an indictment is not a finding of guilt. an individual charged by indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.    united states attorney erek l. barron commended irs-ci and the fbi for their work in the investigation. mr. barron thanked assistant u.s. attorneys leo j. wise, sean r. delaney, and aaron s.j. zelinsky, who are prosecuting the federal case."

engaging in more than $1.2 million in fraud related to the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security (cares) act, and to committing tax fraud. the sentence is the first handed down in the district of south carolina for a case involving cares act fraud.    the defendant in this case not only stole from the federal government and engaged in tax fraud, but she prevented funds from reaching the hands of those who needed it the most. that this occurred during a pandemic makes her crimes particularly egregious, said u.s. attorney ellis. this case highlights the department of justice's commitment to prosecuting those who illegally take advantage of covid-19 to line their own pockets. fortunately, the quick and capable work of our federal partners permitted the recovery of a substantial amount of stolen funds.    it is always a shame to see the rampant abuse of programs designed to help ordinary people struggling through the pandemic, said brian thomas assistant special agent in charge, internal revenue service (irs) criminal investigation, charlotte field office. the irs will continue to thoroughly investigate and vigorously target those who exploit the pandemic to commit tax fraud, and this case speaks to those efforts.    the treasury inspector general for tax administration aggressively pursues those who attempt to defraud the american public by fraudulently obtaining taxpayer-funded loans through the coronavirus, aid, relief, and economic security act paycheck protection program which is designed to assist legitimate business owners during the pandemic, said j. russell george, treasury inspector general for tax administration (tigta). we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners and the u.s. attorney's office to ensure this criminal activity is held to account.    the cares act is a federal law enacted in march 2020 designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the coronavirus. two primary sources of relief provided by the cares act were the paycheck protection program (ppp) and the economic injury disaster loan (eidl) program. ppp loans consisted of more than $640 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for payroll, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. the eidl program provided low-interest loans to business owners to pay for items like accounts payable and other bills that could not be paid as a result of covid-19.    evidence presented to the court showed that from april 2020 through august 2020, dorsey fraudulently applied for and received $1,253,460.35 by way of seven eidl and two ppp loans, along with two eidl cash advances, on behalf of seven businesses for which she was the alleged owner. each of the applications dorsey submitted contained materially false information, including overstating the businesses' revenues, inflating the number of employees, or providing addresses where businesses did not exist. in some cases, dorsey created and submitted false documentation or created businesses for the sole purpose of obtaining the loans.    during their investigation into dorsey's coronavirus-related fraud, agents with the irs-ci and tigta discovered dorsey had also been engaged in fraudulent tax return preparation through one of her businesses, virtual financial services. specifically, dorsey prepared multiple tax returns on behalf of others and claimed deductions she knew were false.    the quick work of irs-ci and tigta enabled the agencies to seize more than $500,000 of stolen funds that were in bank accounts controlled by dorsey, and another account with approximately $130,000 was frozen. these funds will be applied toward the restitution dorsey owes in the case. additionally, dorsey paid approximately $184,000 in restitution before sentencing.    senior united states district judge cameron mcgowan currie sentenced dorsey to 24 months in federal prison, to be followed by a three-year term of court-ordered supervision. there is no parole in the federal system. the court also ordered her to pay more than $1 million in restitution stemming from her cares act-related fraud, in addition to $13,865 in restitution to the irs as a result of her tax fraud.    the case was investigated by the irs-ci and tigta. assistant united states attorney derek shoemake, who also serves as the office's coronavirus fraud coordinator, prosecuted the case.    on may 17, 2021, the attorney general established the covid-19 fraud enforcement task force to marshal the resources of the department of justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. the task force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts."

tulsa and the surrounding areas, as part of operation booster buster. five defendants remain at large.    the u.s. attorney's office and the oklahoma attorney general's office charged a total of 29 defendants with taking part in the largescale retail theft ring staged out of northeastern oklahoma.    organized retail crime is costly to the economic well-being of our communities. this alleged retail theft ring is estimated to have caused retailers more than $10 million in losses, said u.s. attorney clint johnson. a joint team of investigators have worked meticulously over the past several years to connect the evidence and bring this case forward for prosecution. i am thankful for their professionalism and persistence.    this investigation was complex, challenging, and lengthy, oklahoma attorney general john o'connor said. these are serious crimes. organized crime is on the rise nationwide, and my office is committed to holding criminals accountable for their actions. i want to thank the state, local, and federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors for their work and partnership in this case.    charges were announced at a press conference thursday. u.s. attorney johnson and oklahoma attorney general o'connor were joined by special agent in charge christopher altemus jr. of irs-criminal investigation, tulsa chief of police wendell franklin, special agent in charge christopher miller of homeland security investigations, and tulsa county sheriff vic regalado.    stores targeted include reasor's, sprouts, walmart, sam's club, costco, walgreens, cvs, gnc and others.    for example, on sept. 4, 2019, defendants amber clayson, latoya duhart and others allegedly boosted $1,329 worth of over-the-counter products, such as flonase, mucinex, nexium, zegerid, and allegra, from a reasor's in jenks, oklahoma.    according to the federal indictment and the state's probable cause affidavit, defendant linda been led the ring of boosters that netted $4.5 million from the sale of stolen merchandise and over-the-counter products to fencing organizations outside of oklahoma. fences then sold the stolen products through e-commerce sites, like ebay and amazon.    normally, fences paid been half the market value for each item. been, in turn, paid boosters half of her expected profit for each item they brought to her. financial payments for stolen products were normally made through paypal, venmo, and cash app, and some payments were made with drugs.    been provided her boosters with a detailed list of items to steal and the pricing she would pay for each. she further instructed her ring on boosting techniques, including box stuffing. box stuffing occurs when criminals conceal higher-value items inside lower-value item boxes and only paying for the lower-valued items.    been and her team of boosters allegedly stole products from retailers in oklahoma, kansas, texas, missouri, arkansas, and colorado. been would pay boosters' expenses when they traveled outside the state. she would further pay boosters' bond when arrested so they could continue boosting.    boosters would then deliver the goods to predetermined locations in tulsa, sand springs, and cleveland, oklahoma. defendants billy osborne, juston osborne, corey fields, and amanda johnson allegedly helped manage the operation by storing stolen inventory at their residences or businesses and by prepping the merchandise for bulk shipments to fences outside the state. been also stored stolen merchandise at her residences, prepared inventories, coordinated payment, and shipped the pallets of stolen items.    consumers and businesses incur a high price for thieves who commit larcenies and profit by selling their stolen goods to well organized theft rings, said tulsa police chief wendell franklin. thieves should take notice. tulsa is not going to capitulate and allow criminals to disrupt commerce in our city.    these federal indictments are a result of the tremendous work and collaboration accomplished by our trusted law enforcement partners, said christopher miller, acting special agent in charge hsi dallas. it does not matter where these criminal networks operate and sell their illegally acquired goods. we will work without end to ensure those involved are investigated and brought to justice.    the investigation into the retail theft ring began in 2019 when an organized crime investigator from a pharmacy retailer shared information with tulsa police detectives about bulk thefts at their tulsa area locations. investigators linked several boosters in the tulsa area to been and her son, state defendant curtis leon gann jr. they also noted that been and gann jr. were allegedly selling over-the-counter medications, along with other commonly stolen items on their ebay accounts.    the tulsa police department reached out to lead investigator agent thomas helm with the oklahoma attorney general's office. once it was determined that crimes linked to been's retail theft organization also occurred in surrounding states, a federal investigation was launched.    the u.s. attorney's office, the oklahoma attorney general's office, tulsa police department, homeland security investigations (hsi), and irs criminal investigation joined forces to lead operation booster buster. hsi task force officers from the tulsa county sheriff's office also joined in the investigation.    irs-criminal investigation, u.s. immigration and customs enforcement's homeland security investigations, the tulsa police department, oklahoma attorney general's office, and tulsa county sheriff's office conducted the investigation. assistant u.s. attorney's richard m. cella and reagan v. reininger are prosecuting the case on behalf of the federal

reward his fake 'donors' with reimbursement for their contributions; and provided receipts enabling the 'donations' to be written off as charitable contributions, all in furtherance of the scheme. the fbi will continue to root out fraud disguised as charitable donations which ultimately hurts those organizations relying on the generosity of donors.    rabbi goldstein was ordered to surrender into federal custody by noon on february 23, 2022."

other times they used portions of it to pay contractors who had in fact charged much lower prices than reflected on avergoon's phony paperwork.    apart from his fraudulent partnership with rabbi goldstein, avergoon also admitted to participating in separate real estate ponzi schemes from 2010 to 2016, in which he cheated retirement investors out of a total of $12 million. avergoon was a san diego-based real estate agent, and he used his industry knowledge and reputation to target trusting victims who would invest in what they thought was the purchase of rental property.    avergoon promised monthly dividends that would be paid from rental income. he created written investment materials like prospectus and projected income and expenses calculations, designed to give investors the false impression that their money would be safely tucked away in passive-income retirement investments. but in truth, instead of using investors' money to buy rental properties as he promised, avergoon spent the money himself and just pretended that he had purchased the apartment buildings and office space he advertised. in true ponzi fashion, for a time, avergoon made the promised dividend paymentsbut rather than using rent income, he funded those payments using new investor money.    avergoon deceived more than a dozen unwitting investors, convincing them to part with at least $5 million. when an investor would ask to cash out, he encouraged them to re-invest, and at one point he pretended to roll over their retirement investments to purchase a multi-million-dollar commercial building. in reality, he bought that building with a loan, not with investor money, and again diverted their money to his own personal use. he created fake partnership agreements, false purchase documents and deeds, and other fictitious records, and forged the signatures of his investors to conceal the fraudthen laundered the proceeds in order to disguise the true source and ownership of the money.    avergoon did not stop there. he convinced investors to part with another $5 million or more by pretending to use their money to fund short-term, low-risk loans supposedly secured by the borrowers' high-end san diego homes. but in reality, there were no borrowers  avergoon used his real estate connections to identify homes he could pose as collateral, and he simply doctored up fake loan agreements and forged the borrowers' signatures. in some cases, the individuals he claimed were the borrowers did not even own the homes that were purportedly used as collateral. avergoon made fake loan agreements, deeds of trust, mortgage notes, and other official-looking documents, and he even created fake notary stamps and san diego county recorder's office markings to make the paperwork appear legitimate. once again, avergoon used new investor money to make occasional payments to his victims, to make it appear that the loans were performing. but in truth, he diverted the money to his own use and the investments were worthless.    avergoon was indicted in august 2019 and apprehended in latvia. he was extradited to the united states in november 2019 and has remained in custody since his extradition and initial appearance in federal court in san diego."

committing honest services wire fraud as san francisco department of public works (dpw) head    date:  december 17, 2021    contact:   newsroom@ci.irs.gov    san francisco  former san francisco city hall public official mohammed nuru agreed in a plea agreement filed today to plead guilty to honest services wire fraud, announced acting united states attorney stephanie m. hinds, federal bureau of investigation special agent in charge craig d. fair, and internal revenue servicecriminal investigation special agent in charge mark h. pearson.    today's development follows the january 15, 2020, 79-page federal complaint filed against then san francisco department of public works (dpw) director mohammed nuru charging him with public corruption and describing a long-running scheme involving multiple bribes and kickbacks during his tenure as dpw's director. nuru, 59, of san francisco, served as dpw's director from 2011 until charges were brought against him in 2020. nuru was also charged in a second federal complaint filed on january 28, 2020, with lying to a federal agent in the course of the san francisco city hall corruption investigation. today, in anticipation of entering his plea agreement resolving his cases, nuru was arraigned today on an information  a charging document  that charges him with his sweeping scheme to defraud the san francisco public of its right to his honest services in violation of 18 u.s.c.  1343 and 1346.    mohammed nuru admits to a staggering amount of public corruption in his plea agreement, said acting united states attorney stephanie m. hinds. for years, nuru held a powerful and well-paid public leadership position at san francisco city hall, but instead of serving the public, nuru served himself. he took continuous bribes from the contractors, developers, and entities he regulated. he now faces a prison sentence for enriching himself at the expense of the public as he sat in high office. federal authorities will investigate public corruption wherever it leads in san francisco and throughout the district.    today's announcement, while significant, is by no means the end of the fbi's investigation into the corrupt conduct we have uncovered in san francisco city government, said fbi special agent in charge d. fair. we will continue to hold accountable those who seek to personally benefit by corrupting the fair administration of public business and we will persist in our commitment to protect the integrity of the institutions that serve the people of san francisco.    our communities place great trust and responsibility in our public figures. mohammed nuru ultimately betrayed this trust when he abused his power to defraud the city and county of san francisco and its people, said irs criminal investigation special agent in charge mark h. pearson. we will not tolerate public corruption and will hold perpetrators accountable for their actions. today's guilty plea is a direct result of the hard work and dedication of irs criminal investigation and our law enforcement partners towards obtaining justice.    nuru signed today's plea agreement and the agreement has been filed with the united states district court in preparation for nuru's upcoming appearance to enter his guilty plea orally. as the plea agreement outlines, before nuru was appointed director of dpw in 2011 he became dpw's deputy director of operations in 2000. the deputy director of operations is dpw's second most senior position, behind only the director. in 2014, nuru was also appointed to the board of the transbay joint powers authority (tjpa) and eventually served as its chair. as deputy director and eventually director of dpw, and as chair of the tjpa, nuru exercised great influence over san francisco (the city) business and policy, including public contracts, permits, and construction projects. his power and influence extended beyond dpw's jurisdiction to numerous other city departments and agencies, making him one of the most powerful public officials in the city.    nuru admits in his plea agreement to a spectrum of public corruption involving bribery and kickbacks he received while in dpw leadership. his admissions are summarized below:    walter wong:    in his plea agreement, nuru admits he received a stream of bribes from walter wong. wong did business in the city through walter wong construction, among other businesses. in exchange for wong's bribes, nuru helped wong secure city contracts. sometimes nuru provided wong with confidential insider city information on competitors' bids or specifications. at other times nuru allowed wong to structure the requirements for the city's request for proposals (rfp) for projects ahead of time, to tailor their requirements to ensure that wong's company would be the most-qualified bidder. nuru also helped wong expedite permit approvals.    nuru admits in his plea agreement that his corrupt relationship with wong began in approximately 2008 when nuru was the deputy director for operations at dpw. wong installed a gate for free at nuru's san francisco home in exchange for future business with dpw and the city. wong continued to perform construction services for free, or nearly free, at nuru's san francisco home and later primarily at nuru's vacation ranch property in colusa county.    nuru admits that, in exchange for wong providing construction and other things of value, he exercised his official influence and took actions to benefit wong. in one example outlined in the plea agreement, nuru used dpw's emergency contract process, which did not require a public bidding process, to direct construction work to walter wong construction on a navigation center located at 1515 south van ness street and on the jelani house (a housing shelter), resulting in city payments to wong's company during fiscal years 2017-2018 and 2019-2020. in another example, nuru used his position and official influence to direct dpw, the market street association, and the san francisco public utilities commission to purchase christmas lights from one of wong's businesses, regularly leading to tens of thousands of dollars' worth of purchases.    nuru further admits in his plea agreement that:    between approximately 2008 and january 2020, wong provided in excess of $260,000 in labor and materials for work on nuru's san francisco home and colusa county ranch.  	 wong paid for home furnishings for nuru, including a chandelier, kitchen appliances, and furniture.  	 wong paid for nuru to travel to china multiple times and to south america on one occasion, which included reimbursing nuru in cash for the cost of international flights. wong paid for nuru and sandra zuniga, his girlfriend at the time, to accompany nuru to south america and paid for their stay at the ritz-carlton in santiago, chile.  	 on multiple occasions, wong handed nuru envelopes of cash, often as much as $5,000 at a time."
